# Image-Clustering
Clustering of handwritten digits converted to pixels using K-Means Algorithm.

<h3>Data Description</h3>
Input data consists of 10,000 images of handwritten digits(0-9). The images were scanned and scaled into 28x28 pixels. For every digit, each pixel can be represented as an integer in the range [0, 255] where 0 corresponds to the pixel being completely white, and 255 corresponds to the pixel being completely black. Thi gives us a 28x28 matrix of integers for each digit. We can then flatten each matrix into a 1x784 vector. No labels are provided.
